/**
 * Question Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-boomerangs/
 * Primary idea: traverse the array and compare distance one by one
 * Given n points in the plane that are all pairwise distinct, a "boomerang" is a tuple of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j equals the distance between i and k (the order of the tuple matters).
 
 Find the number of boomerangs. You may assume that n will be at most 500 and coordinates of points are all in the range [-10000, 10000] (inclusive).
 
 Example:
 Input:
 [[0,0],[1,0],[2,0]]
 
 Output:
 2
 
 Explanation:
 The two boomerangs are [[1,0],[0,0],[2,0]] and [[1,0],[2,0],[0,0]]
 * Time Complexity: O(n^2), Space Complexity: O(n)
 *
